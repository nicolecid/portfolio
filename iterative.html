                If someone told you to create an educational app for children, what would spring to mind? How would you
                make an app both educational and fun? Images? Bright colors? Exploding science experiments? Dinosaurs?

                This is what my teammates and I were trying to explore. For this project, we had to choose a startup and
                design a user interface (UI) for that startup without looking at their existing UI. The only thing we
                could work off of was their concept.

                The startup we chose is
                <a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/">Tappity</a>
                , an app for kids which teaches 100+ science topics with experiments and
                games. The app is specifically for children aged 4-10 and explores topics, such as space, animals, the
                human body etc.

                In this article, we're going to walk you through our brainstorming, how we created an interactive
                prototype, and an analysis of our results after conducting user testing.

                My teammates were Deniz Ozturk, Sharon Alexander, and Mariana Alvaro

            <div class='body-text'>
                Before creating low-fidelity wireframes, we discussed our individual sketches and came to the following
                decisions:
            </div>
            <div class='body-text'>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We thought that it would be fun and engaging for kids to let them create and customize their own
                        avatar. Instead of a human avatar, we wanted a more interesting and gender-neutral creature.
                        Very quickly it became crystal clear - it had to be a dinosaur! We then decided that for
                        consistency, the app's icon should be a dinosaur as well.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We decided to cheer up our login page with a "knock, knock, who's there" joke which prompts the
                        user to choose between logging in as the parent or the child

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We knew that we wanted to split the homepage into three categories: games, experiments, and
                        educational videos. However, we spent a lot of time deciding which word to use for educational
                        videos. We thought that "learning" or "classroom" would put off children so we went with
                        "Discover".

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Initially, we planned to have a "Games" button which would lead directly to a path made up of
                        individual games across different themes e.g. animals, space, machines etc. Once a child
                        completes all games for a specific theme, they would arrive at an endpoint where they would
                        collect some sort of gear for their avatar. We believe this would incentivize children to
                        continue playing and we used the same logic for educational videos and experiments.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Later on, we realized that it would be more intuititve and organized to divide the games into
                        topics and then create a topics page before navigating the user to the games path. For example,
                        if the user clicks on "Animals", it would take them to a path made up of only animal games. This
                        would also allow kids to choose which games they want to play.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                Critique Feedback
            </div>

            <div class='body-text'>
                The mockup you see above is our final draft after receiving feedback from Nikolas Klein, an industry
                Product Designer, and other students in our UI/UX class at Brown. The following is a summary of the
                critique:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make it more clear which is the parent dinosaur and which is the child and use this parent-child relationship throughout the app. Originally, on page 1 (login page), both the parent and child dinosaurs were green. We later changed the parent to orange and for consistency, we also made this change on page 8 and 9 to the astronaut and safari tourguide dinosaurs. This makes it seem as if the child's parent is cheering them on by the "You are doing great!" speech bubble on pages 8 and 9.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the game path, highlight where the dinosaur is standing to make it more clear as to which game the child is meant to complete. We decided to highlight the game icon with a drop shadow.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Overall, Nikolas and our peers liked the choice of colors and graphics and said that the app was easy to navigate.

                After creating our interactive high-fidelity mockup, how do we know if it's actually user friendly? This is where user testing comes into play. We submitted our mockup to a remote user testing service
                <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">(usertesting.com)</a>
                and had 3 users test our interface prototype. We gave all 3 users the following tasks and scenario:

                Imagine you're a child and you want to play a "Space" game and then an "Animals" game. Keep in mind that this is a mockup made with prototyping software and not a real website. However, like a real application, you will be able to interact with elements on each page to help you achieve your goal. Since it's a prototype, you won't actually be able to play a game but they would be included in the real application.

                NOTE: when creating our test on usertesting.com, we chose tablet as the device that users should use. However, we were unaware that despite specifying this, users without tablets would still receive this test. This caused formatting issues for 2/3 of our test users, since they were trying to open up the prototype on a computer/mobile instead of a tablet. If we were to conduct this test again, we would either specify that using a tablet is highly recommended in the scenario or change our prototype so that it is responsive to different devices.
