        The goal of this project was to pick an interface, observe people using the interface and analyze their actions.
        <br>
         The trash cans around the Brown University campus are there for students,
        staff, and visitors to discard their trash properly. It reduces the amount
        of trash people leave around campus. There are two bins always adjacent to each other.
        One is for regular trash and the other is for recycling. Users approach any of the bins,
        open the covering and discard their waste in the correct bin. They have two choices on how
        to open the cover, by pulling on the handle or by stepping on the foot press. Moreover, there is
        a green light that turnes red indicating the user if the trash bin is about to be full or if it is reaching its
        limit soon.

        <ul>
          <li>
            After observing several users use the interface,
            it is evident that many just choose to dispose all of their trash in the regular trash bin
            as opposed to separating it into recyclables and non-recyclables.

          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, it was noticed
            that most users did not know about the foot press even after using the trash can several times.
            Thus, they used the handle to open the lid.
          <li>
            Most users do not pay attention to the limit indicator. They ignore the light and just try
            to push the trash in or put it in the recycling bin instead.
          </li>

          <li>
            Most users walk with the trash in one hand, which leaves them with one free hand to pull
            on the handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users often do not wait for the bins to close before walking away.

        What do you think can be improved with the user interface of the trash bins around campus?
      </div>
      <div class='body-text'>
        <ul>
          User 1: I would like for the trash and recycling bins to give a more noticeable signal when it is full. This
          is
          because now they do have a small light, but sometimes the light is red even if the bin is not full yet and
          sometimes it is not even on. I would also make the bins open when they sense movement. This would eliminate
          all
          contact with the bin and it would be very convenient.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          User 2: It would be better if the compartment where you put the trash goes back to its normal state faster. I
          feel
          like sometimes I need to leave quickly, but also want to make sure that my trash was properly disposed and it
          takes the lid too long to go back to normal and actually throw the trash inside the bin.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          User 3: It would be better if they trash bins could have a clearer signal that there is a foot press that will
          also open the covering. I feel most people never use it because they do not know it is there. They will just
          try
          to open the trashcan with their full hands somehow.
        </ul>

          How does this trash bins compare to others you have used?
        </div>
        <div class='body-text'>
          <ul>
            User 1: The trash can is very good at containing smell in. I have never encountered one where I open it to
            dispose
            my trash and could smell the trash. I also like how it requires very little contact to throw away my trash.
            Specially now with Covid-19, I do not want to touch surfaces with my hands and the foot press is perfect to
            open
            it. </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: I like that it is easy to use. It is very straightforward and does not require much thinking or
            processing
            to use. I also like that there is a solar panel on the top part of the bins that makes the light that signals
            fullness work. </ul>
          <ul>
            User 3: I like that it requires little strength to open. It is also very convenient that it has the recycling
            bin
            clearly labeled from the regular trash bin. The different colors and symbols in these are essential to let the
            user know which is which. </ul>

        The user chooses to discard their waste. They looks around for the nearest available trash bin and proceed to
        grab trash on one hand. The user then walks over to the trash bins and looks confused. They then try to open the
        regular trash bin, but find themselves exerting an abnormal amount of force on the handle. The covering does
        open. They then realize that the red light on the side of the bin is turned on, which leads the user to think that
        the bin is full. As they grow in frustration, they quickly decide to dispose of their trash in the adjacent
        recycling bin and leave.

        Frustrated Ale is a student at Brown University. Between his concentrations in Political Science and Economics,
        clubs, and soccer, Ale’s schedule is busy trying to fulfill requirements and doing what he enjoys. Being the
        strong athlete he is, he gets easily frustrated when things are hard to open. Also, because of his busy schedule
        any minor setback in his calendar stresses him out. Ale tries to recycle and follow recycling guidelines as much
        as he can, but acknowledges that he is not always conscious of doing it.

        The user finished eating their to-go meal as they are walking on a campus tour. They have wrappers and a food
        container
        on one hand and a coffee cup on the other. They wish to dispose of them, so they look around and find the nearest
        trash bin. They walk towards it and see that there is only a handle to open the covering. They get desperate as
        the tour group is walking away. The user tries to open the covering with their elbow and succeeds but made the
        task
        unnecessarily hard. They disposes of their trash only to notice that there was a foot press that would open the
        covering. They walk away fast and join the tour group again.
