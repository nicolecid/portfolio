                It is very common for webpages to have several variations of their page in order to see what
                modifications or updates users prefer most. For example, have you and your friends had different updates
                of Instagram? I have. My feed still shows the number of likes in each picture, while that of my roommate
                does not. These two versions of the same page are there to test user preference and their actions.
                <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I created two versions of a website. I then deployeed the website and sent the link
                to around 40 participants.
                When they clicked the link, the were directed to one of the versions randomly. Once in the website,
                participants were asked to add $150
                to the cart. The data was then collected in logs that registered all user interactions with the website.
                The alternate version is option A, and the control is B as seen in the picture below.

                The time to completion of version A is the same as the time to completion of version B.

                The time to complete the task for version A would be much faster than that for version B.
                This is
                because the prices in version A are bigger and the names of the products are shorter. This
                makes it
                easier and faster to add items to the cart.

            <div class='body-text'>
                The return rate will be different between version A and version B because version B has a
                better text hierarchy than that
                of version A.

                Data Collection
            </div>

            <div class='body-text'>
                To collect all the data, 40 users were asked to participate. They were given a link that when
                they clicked on it, it would randomly direct them
                to version A or version B of the webpage. Once they were in the webpage they were instructed to
                add $150 worth of products to the cart. Many users
                then went to the checkout page to check if they did reach the $150 dolar minimum limit, and if
                they did not, they would go back and modify their cart.
                If the user returned to the page from the cart, that was counted for the return rate. We cared
                if the user returned or not, not how many times they returned.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, while the users completed the task, all their actions was recorded in logs. These logs
                demonstrated the time where the page loaded, if they clickd
                on any buttons, if they went to the checkout page, and more. These logs were then converted to a
                csv file to be analyzed in a spreadsheet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once in the spreadsheet, the Time to Completion was calculated by going manually through all the
                logs and looking when the user last loaded the page and substracting the initial
                loading time from that. Additionally, for every user, the return count was also manually
                calculated by counting which users returned to the page after the checkout and which did not.
                As stated above, what was important was if they returned or not, not how many times they
                returned.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, a python script was ran with the data from the spreadsheet and the values obtained
                were the following:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        T-scoreee for Time to Completion:

                        -0.38125016328080724
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>

                        P-value for the test of Time to completion:
                        <br>
                        0.35362372187189156

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Chi^2 value for the test of Return rate:

                        4.791111111111112

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        P-value Return Rate:
                        <br>
                        0.02860696714121902

                Analysis of Results
            </div>
            <div class='body-text'>
                Looking at the p-value for Time to Completion, it can be determined that the the testing failed
                to reject the null. This is due to the p-value (alpha) being
                more than 5%. Therefore, the test was inconclusive and did not show any significant difference
                between version A and version B.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, looking at the p-value of the Return Rate, it can be determined that the testing
                rejected the null hypothesis. This is also because the alpha
                value is smaller than 5%. Therefore, the testing concludes and there is a significant difference
                between the return rate of version A and version B.

            <div class='body-text'>
                In conclusion my testing rejected the null hypothesis for return rate meaning that there was a
                difference in the return rate between version A and version B.
                Moreover, it failed to reject the null with the time to completion.
